## Negotiation Process

1. **Prepare**: plan your negotiation strategy
2. **Negotiate**: Use key tactics for success
3. **Close**: Create a contract
4. **Perform and Evaluate**: achieve positive results

## Prepare

### 1.1 Decide if you should negotiate at all

- Don't negotiate when it doesn't make sense (e.g. negotiating prices at a supermarket)
- Don't negotiate if the required effort exceeds potential gains (e.g. takes too much time for analysis)

### 1.2 Decide if a negotiation is position-based or interest-based

Don't ask somebody else what they want (what's their position), instead ask why they want it 
(what's their underlying interest). 

*Example*: Dividing an anchovies pizza:
 - Position-based: one person cuts the pizza in half, the other person chooses the piece.
 - Interest-based: ask both sides why they want the pizze - it's possible one party wants the pizza because he likes 
 anchovies (wants the center but not crust), and the other party wants the crust. By identifying interests a win-win 
 situation is created - parties got what they want without taking away what the other party wants.

| Win / Lose | Win / Win |
| Zero Sum | Non-zero Sum |
| Adversarial | Problem-solving |

### 1.3 Decide if a negotiation is dispute-resolution or deal-making

| **Deal making** | **Dispute resolution** |
| --- | --- |
| Forward Looking | Backward Looking |
| Competitive | Position-based |
| Problem Solving | Adversarial |

Spectrum of dispute resolution processes:

1. **Avoidance**
1. **Negotiation**
1. **Mediation**
1. **Arbitration**
1. **Litigation**
1. **Power**

These processes can be looked at through different lenses:

- **Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)**: Negotiation, Mediation, Arbitration.

- **Third Party Processes**: Mediation, Arbitration, Litigation.

- **Power**, **Rights** (Litigation, Arbitration), **Interests** (Mediation, Negotiation).
    
### 1.4 Complete a negotiation analysis

**Reservation price** - the least favourable point (e.g. lowest price for seller) at which one will accept a 
negotiated agreement. There is a risk in choosing a too large stretch goal - you may lose credibility.

**Stretch goal** - the most favourable point (e.g. highest price for seller) that one can justify in an
agreement.

**Expected price** - most likely price. 

**Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA)** - the most advantageous alternative course of action a party 
can take if negotiations fail and an agreement cannot be reached.

**Zone Of Potential Agreement (ZOPA)** - where the deal can take place, 
the range between reservation prices of the counterparties.

### 1.6 Resolve ethical issues in negotiations
