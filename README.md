## Negotiation Process

1. **Prepare**: plan your negotiation strategy
2. **Negotiate**: Use key tactics for success
3. **Close**: Create a contract
4. **Perform and Evaluate**: achieve positive results

## Prepare

### 1.1 Decide if you should negotiate at all

- Don't negotiate when it doesn't make sense (e.g. negotiating prices at a supermarket)
- Don't negotiate if the required effort exceeds potential gains (e.g. takes too much time for analysis)

### 1.2 Decide if a negotiation is position-based or interest-based

Don't ask somebody else what they want (what's their position), instead ask why they want it 
(what's their underlying interest). 

*Example*: Dividing an anchovies pizza:
 - Position-based: one person cuts the pizza in half, the other person chooses the piece.
 - Interest-based: ask both sides why they want the pizze - it's possible one party wants the pizza because he likes 
 anchovies (wants the center but not crust), and the other party wants the crust. By identifying interests a win-win 
 situation is created - parties got what they want without taking away what the other party wants.
 
| **Dividing the pie** | **Enlarging the pie** |
| --- | --- |
| Distributive | Integrative |
| Competitive | Cooperative |
| Win / Lose | Win / Win |
| Zero Sum | Non-zero Sum |
| Adversarial | Problem-solving |
| Position-based | Interest-based |
| Claiming Value | Creating Value |
 
### 1.3 Decide if a negotiation is dispute-resolution or deal-making

| **Deal making** | **Dispute resolution** |
| --- | --- |
| Forward Looking | Backward Looking |
| Competitive | Position-based |
| Problem Solving | Adversarial |

Spectrum of dispute resolution processes:

1. **Avoidance**
1. **Negotiation**
1. **Mediation**
1. **Arbitration**
1. **Litigation**
1. **Power**

These processes can be looked at through different lenses:

- **Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)**: Negotiation, Mediation, Arbitration.

- **Third Party Processes**: Mediation, Arbitration, Litigation.

- **Power**, **Rights** (Litigation, Arbitration), **Interests** (Mediation, Negotiation).
    
### 1.4 Complete a negotiation analysis

**Reservation price** - the least favourable point (e.g. lowest price for seller) at which one will accept a 
negotiated agreement. There is a risk in choosing a too large stretch goal - you may lose credibility.

**Stretch goal** - the most favourable point (e.g. highest price for seller) that one can justify in an
agreement.

**Expected price** - most likely price. 

**Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA)** - the most advantageous alternative course of action a party 
can take if negotiations fail and an agreement cannot be reached. In dispute resolution BATNA is often 
litigation or arbitration. 

**Zone Of Potential Agreement (ZOPA)** - where the deal can take place, 
the range between reservation prices of the counterparties. 
    
### 1.5 Conduct cross-cultural negotiations

- **Surface culture** - negotiation style. **Deep culture** - underlying values and beliefs.

- Be sensitive to culture but don't stereotype. 

- Should you adapt the culture of the other side? There are a few problems with adaptation: 
(1) both sides might modify behaviour, (2) you don't fully understand the local culture. **Therefore**: 
moderate adaptation is often better than major adaptation. Ultimately the success of negotiation **depends on respect**
of each other rather than style. 
    
### 1.6 Resolve ethical issues in negotiations

**Law-based Ethical Standards**:
- **Fraud** - false representation of a material fact that is relied on by the other side
  - Example: if during negotiation you lied to the other side about your reservation price, it's not a fraud, because
  this is not relied on by the other side.
- **Fiduciary Duty** - a high duty of trust and loyalty. 
An an employee you owe the duty of trust and loyalty to your employer. E.g. as an agent for making a deal for
a company you can't accept a finders fee from the other company. 
- **Unconscionability** - violates principles of good conscience.  It is a doctrine in contract law that describes 
terms that are so extremely unjust, or overwhelmingly one-sided in favor of the party who has the superior bargaining 
power, that they are contrary to good conscience. Typically, an unconscionable contract is held to be unenforceable 
because no reasonable or informed person would otherwise agree to it.

**General Ethical Standards**
- **Organization standards** - companies can have standards guiding the decisions in certain situations. 
- **Mentor** - what would someone you admire do in the situation.
- **Personal standards**: Gut test, Family and Newspaper (ask yourself if you would be embarassed to have your family 
members learn about your actions), Golder Rule (treat others as you want to be treated).  
    
### 1.7 Decide if you should use an agent in a negotiation

- Is the agent a better negotiator?
- Does the agent have more experience in negotiating the issues?
- Does the negotiation involve a technical matter that requires the expertise of an agent?
- How much time do I have to invest in a negotiation?
- What is my rerelationship with the other side?

When you are dealing with an agent you have to ask if the agent has the **authority** from the principal to do the deal.
E.g. general managers have no authority to guarantee loans made by employees. 


## Distinctive features of US litigation system

**[Contingency Fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingent_fee)** - fee charged for a lawyer's services only if the 
lawsuit is successful or is favorably 
settled out of court. Contingency fees are usually calculated as a percentage of the client's net recovery.

**[Class Actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action)** - is a type of lawsuit where one of the parties is a 
group of people who are represented 
collectively by a member of that group. 

**[Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(law))** - is a pre-trial procedure in a lawsuit, in which each 
party can obtain evidence from the other party 
by means of discovery devices such as a request for answers to interrogatories, request for production of documents, 
request for admissions and depositions.

**[Punitive damages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punitive_damages)** - damages exceeding simple compensation and 
awarded to punish the defendant.

The **[American rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_rule_(attorney%27s_fees))** provides that each party is 
responsible for paying its own attorney's fees. It contrasts with the English rule, under which the losing party 
pays the prevailing party's attorneys' fees.

## Negotiate

### 2.1 Get to know the other side

- Avoid your favorite topic - or else you'll probably talk too much.
- Ask a lot of questions. People love to talk about themselves and often will think you are a great conversationalist
if you talk about them.
- Listening is crucial. Dan Naian has learned to summarize what the other person says. ("So you think that..."
or "So what you are saying is...") "A conversation can go on indefinitely if you do this" he says.

### 2.2 Understand your power

**Information** is the main source of power in a negotiation - ask questions and listen carefully to the answers.

Knowing **your BATNA** and **the other side's BATNA** gives you power in a negotiation.
- Improve your BATNA - improve your power. 
  - Develop alternatives. You would never do a deal without talking to anyone else.
  - Tell your BATNA to the other side if it's strong.
- Weaken their BATNA - weaken their power. 
  - Tell the other side if their BATNA is weak.
  
Forming a **coalition** is another powerful form of negitation.

### 2.3 Use psychological tools and avoid traps

1. **Mythical Fixed Pie Assumption**: we assume that our interests are in direct conflict with the interests of the other
side.
  - Reactive devaluation: during negotiation, because we think of the other side as a competitor we tend to react to
  their proposals by devaluing them. When you fall into this trap you lose the opportunity to consider what might be
  a great proposal that satisfies your interests.
2. **Anchoring**: we anchor on an initial value when estimating the value of uncertain objects.
3. **Overconfidence**: we are overconfident that our judgements are correct. 
  - When making decision try to be realistic. When implementing ideas you can be optimistic.
4. **Framing**: the way that options are framed cause us to be risk averse (if positive frame) or
risk seeking (if negative frame).
5. **Availability**: we are influenced by information that is most easily available. 
6. **Escalation**: the most successful negotiators look at negotiations from the perspective of the other side.
7. **Reciprocation**: we feel the need to replay what someone has given us.
